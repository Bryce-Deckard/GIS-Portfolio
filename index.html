      <p class="text-lg mt-4 max-w-xl"> I’m Bryce Deckard, a Geography graduate from Indiana University with a focus in GIS and Remote Sensing. I use mapping, satellite imagery, and spatial analysis to explore global issues—from environmental change to food vulnerability. This portfolio highlights some of the stories I’ve told using data.</p>

  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg">
    I earned my B.A. in Geography from Indiana University with a concentration in GIS and Remote Sensing. I’m passionate about using spatial analysis to explore international issues, environmental risk, and economic vulnerability. My work combines geospatial tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, and Google Earth Engine with data-driven storytelling. Whether it's tracking algae blooms or mapping hunger hotspots, I approach every project with curiosity and precision.
